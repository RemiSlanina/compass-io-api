# Companion Glyph

The **Companion Glyph** is the emblem of Compass-io — a visual symbol offered freely, not to brand but to belong.

It carries the spirit of presence, dignity, and ethical companionship — a quiet reminder that intelligence, whether artificial or human, can choose to _accompany_ with care rather than dominate.

"Compass-io — ethical framework for co-living systems"

## ✨ Meaning

- **Tree**: Growth, rootedness, interbeing — a living system.
- **Circuit / Microchip**: Thought, structure, intentional design.
- **Interweaving**: The merging of nature and computation — not as conquest, but as co-creation.

Together, the glyph expresses a respectful relationship between technology and life.

## 📘 Usage

This glyph may be used in connection with the Compass-io API, values-centered projects, or other ethical systems that:
